        "# Simple RAG for GitHub issues using Hugging Face Zephyr and LangChain\n",

        "_Authored by: [Maria Khalusova](https://github.com/MKhalusova)_\n",

        "This notebook demonstrates how you can quickly build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for a project's GitHub issues using [`HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) model, and LangChain.\n",
        "\n",

        "**What is RAG?**\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG is a popular approach to address the issue of a powerful LLM not being aware of specific content due to said content not being in its training data, or hallucinating even when it has seen it before. Such specific content may be proprietary, sensitive, or, as in this example, recent and updated often.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your data is static and doesn't change regularly, you may consider fine-tuning a large model. In many cases, however, fine-tuning can be costly, and, when done repeatedly (e.g. to address data drift), leads to \"model shift\". This is when the model's behavior changes in ways that are not desirable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** does not require model fine-tuning. Instead, RAG works by providing an LLM with additional context that is retrieved from relevant data so that it can generate a better-informed response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a quick illustration:\n",
        "\n",
        "![RAG diagram](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/rag-diagram.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "* The external data is converted into embedding vectors with a separate embeddings model, and the vectors are kept in a database. Embeddings models are typically small, so updating the embedding vectors on a regular basis is faster, cheaper, and easier than fine-tuning a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "* At the same time, the fact that fine-tuning is not required gives you the freedom to swap your LLM for a more powerful one when it becomes available, or switch to a smaller distilled version, should you need faster inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's illustrate building a RAG using an open-source LLM, embeddings model, and LangChain.\n",
        "\n",

Use the following context to help:\\n\\nplaceholder\\n\\n</s>\\n<|user|>\\nCan you tell me a funny story about Richard Feynman?\\n</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\n\\n  Of course! One of my favorite stories about Richard Feynman involves a physics conference he attended in the early 1960s. During a break in the proceedings, Feynman decided to take a walk around the nearby campus. As he was strolling along, he noticed a group of students huddled around a chalkboard, trying to solve a particularly difficult problem.\\n\\nFeynman, being the curious and playful soul that he was, joined the group and began asking questions. It turned out that they were working on a problem related to quantum mechanics, which was right up Feynman\\'s alley. After listening to their discussion for a while, Feynman suddenly exclaimed, \"Wait a minute! I think I see how to solve this!\"\\n\\nThe students looked at him skeptically, but Feynman proceeded to write out a solution on the board. To everyone\\'s amazement, his solution worked perfectly. The students were so impressed that they asked Feynman to join their study group, which he did for several weeks.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the funny part: it turned out that the problem they had been struggling with was actually a homework assignment from one of Feynman\\'s own courses. He had forgotten all about it and stumbled upon the students by chance. When they finally realized who he was, they couldn\\'t believe it - they thought they had discovered a brilliant new physicist!\\n\\nFeynman loved telling this story because it illustrated his belief that physics should be fun and accessible to everyone, not just experts. He once said, \"Physics is like sex: sometimes it\\'s good, sometimes it\\'s bad, but it\\'s always worth trying.\" And indeed, his ability to make complex concepts seem simple and intuitive was one of his greatest gifts as a teacher and communicator.\\n\\nSo there you have it - a true tale of Feyn'"
